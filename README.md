**Check the following things to understand our work:**
  * Checkpoint 1:
    * HF.docx: The documentation of our work.
    * DATA/RAW/Measure_01/: Raw measurement files from IMU, MoCap and Robot
    * Code/data_loader.ipynb: You can find the data loading, visualization
  * Checkpoint 2:
    * DATA/RAW/Measure_02/: New improved measurement files from IMU and MoCap
    * Code/data_loader.ipynb: Load and visualize the new measurements
    * Code/MIRAnet_Test_01_MARK.ipynb: Our first 1Dconvnet solution for the problem, based on the code from practice. We tried to predict x and z coordinates here. The results are not perfect, but we see the potential.
