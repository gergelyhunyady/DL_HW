Know How:
The used measurement files located in: 
\..\..\DATA\RAW\Measure_04

===========
First Step:
-----------
1_DataLoad_and_Preprocess.ipynb

Make useable data frame to feed into neural networks
This file feeds from the measurement folder. Details and working description in the file as comments
The output of the file saved as PreprocessedData.txt
This file can be used to generate more dataframe files.

---------
Addition:
---------
Visu_ files explain some detail in the code. Marked at the proper line in 1_DataLoad_and_Preprocess.ipynb
The lot of plot makes the notebook unreadable and overcrowded so the proposed solution is to take the different
plots and visualisation into different independent files.

Contains unused, helpful or old code sniplets. Ideas, that I have not used yet...
